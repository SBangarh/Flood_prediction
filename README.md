# Flood Prediction


## Purpose
To practice, learn, and have fun. link to [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brijlaldhankour/flood-prediction-factors/data)

## Process

Started by loading the data, all files are in a gitignore, but will upload final notebook to Kaggle.

Explored data using visuals and statistical tests. The data was a bit ambigous which made things difficult.

I explored the raw data, tried to decompose it to no avail. I tried to bin the data, but increased dimensionality...Fail. I decided to combined the features into a umbrella category and explore those. I think my final model will be inbetween my raw data and my grouped data.
